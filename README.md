# Obzidi4n's Stupid Simple Tmux.conf 

If your tmux needs are simple (and you're not a Vim person), I think you'll like this one.  

It's ~~ripped off from~~ based on Thayer Williams' [tmux.conf](https://github.com/ddollar/tmux/blob/master/examples/t-williams.conf), so it's clean and elegant.




The **'tick'** character is the hotkey.  It's underneath your tilde ~ character.  

* **tick** and **+** creates a tab.  (well, tick and 'equals' = really)

* **tick** and **-** deletes a tab.

* **tick** and **left/right arrow** gets you from tab to tab.
